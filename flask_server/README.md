## The Flask Server 

> This server needs to be running so that the api request from the nodemcu is successfully responded and the variables get updated.

> To get started, first execute the command below in this directory. (The directory where requirements.txt is present):
```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Navigate to the [server directory](./Tracking_Blockchain_Server/) now:
```
    cd Tracking_Blockchain_Server
```

> Start the server:
```
    python run.py
```
